# Scheduling
Light relay for an aquaponic grow system that is controlled by the daily sunrise and sunset times of Portland, OR. 

We use MATLAB code to read daily sunrise and sunset times from the website https://sunrise-sunset.org/ (specifically for Portland, OR data: https://sunrise-sunset.org/search?location=Portland%2C+OR%2C+United+States ).

Once we retrieve this data we convert into a character array, then a numerical array, eventually to be converted into the daytime array for MATLAB.
